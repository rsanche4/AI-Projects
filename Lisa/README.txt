1: WHAT IS LISA?
   **************
   LISA is written in AIML and uses all of the brain of Alice as well as her own responses. Feel free to talk to her about anything!
   
2: WHAT LIBRARIES DOES SHE USE?
   ****************************
   If you want to run her without the gui, you don't have to install any packages as all the essential ones she uses for parsing arguments and her brain are all pre-installed in python. You only need python installed.
   Here are the libraries she uses if you want to start the GUI in python:
   TKINTER (FOR THE GUI)
   PIL (DISPLAYING IMAGE FOR THE GUI)
   PYGAME (PLAYING MUSIC)
   RANDOM (CREATING RANDOMNESS)
   DATETIME (TELLING THE TIME)
   She also uses AIML for python. Make sure that library is installed using pip install aiml

3: HOW TO TALK TO HER?
   *******************
   If you have Python installed on your system, make sure you have the previous libraries installed (you can use the command "pip install" to install them. Look up "pip" in Google to learn to use it). You can simply open the terminal in this folder and type: python3 gui.py, or python gui.py, or python chatbot_cmd.py, or python3 chatbot_cmd.py.
   
4: DID YOU MAKE THE IMAGE AND MUSIC?
   *********************************
   If you are referring to the GUI version, then no. I got the music from the internet and the image was commissioned. All rights go to their respective owners.
