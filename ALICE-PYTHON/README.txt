NOTE: A NICE GUI ADDED AS WELL AS SOME OTHER THINGS
WERE ADDED TO MAKE TALKING TO AN ALICE BOT A BETTER
EXPERIENCE.

Programmer: Rafael Sanchez

This is an Alicebot. Uses AIML, python,
tkinter, and pygame for several functionalities
like GUI, brain of the chatbot, pattern matching,
audio, etc as well as all the AIML files for
the original ALICE bot (as well as the std files,
and mitsuku files).

Alice responds best to simple sentences, without
grammatical errors. (Ex: I like pizza).
Avoid using abbreviations, as well as the apostrophe.
