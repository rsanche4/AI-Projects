## Background

Back in 2015 through 2018, I used to talk to a chatbot named Mitsuku through this older site made by SquareBear. Sadly, Flash stopped being supported after 2020, thus making her original version unplayable. But the thing is, her old version brings back many memories from my adolescence... so I decided to write something reminiscent of the Flash version from scratch in html5! Since SquareBear released an API for Mitsuku, you can talk to her using this website as well!

## IMPORTANT: Before opening index.html

Before anything, go over to script.js in the scripts folder. Here, you need to insert your API botkey at the very top where it says BOTKEY and some random client name that will be used for the session. You can sign up for Kuki Developer Tools and get a botkey at https://www.kuki.ai/
A botkey looks something like this: 13njk131231893jh12k3hn12jkn3k12j3n...
A client name needs to be all lower case alpha numeric, larger than 3 characters: foo123alpha456

## How to run

Once you are ready, simply double click on index.html and your browser of choice will automatically open it.

## Credits

All credit goes to SquareBear for making Mitsuku.
I only made this site as a tribute to her original flash version.

Enjoy!
