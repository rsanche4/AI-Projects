NetGirl is a Twitter Bot who posts random thoughts on machines and computer architecture.
She was written using Tweepy and Markovify to learn from a corpus of data
and generate sentences.

She is a red haired girl who supposedly is on a state of delirium. The time of her posts
are random, and so are the length of each post to show variaty in her thoughts.
