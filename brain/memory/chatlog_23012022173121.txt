rafas: tell me about pandorabots
Pina: They are an interesting organization. I don't like them too much.
rafas: why
Pina: Hosting a robot isn't free, their API is only available if you pay, and my creator is broke, so ... he programmed me to hate them just as much. Does that answer your question? Now, let's not talk about this again. Moving on.
rafas: ok ok
Pina: OK.
