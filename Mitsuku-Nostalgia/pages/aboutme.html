        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>I am Rafael Sanchez. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and from an early age I have loved computers. In
          my spare time, I like hanging out with friends and acting on stage! Feel free to give me feedback on the
          website by contacting me at <a href="mailto: rsanzek25@gmail.com">rsanzek25@gmail.com</a>. If you are intered
          in more projects of mine, feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/rsanche4">my github</a>!

          <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not associated with SquareBear, the creator of Mitsuku. I did not write
          Mitsuku, so all credits go to him. I only did this site as a fun tribute to such an amazing chatbot.
        </p>
        <h1>The Original Creator</h1>
        <p>Mitsuku was created by Square Bear, a dance music producer from England.
          Square Bear is the artist name of Steve Worswick who has been producing trance and dance since 1998.
          His styles vary from commercial, vocal trance to hard banging dance music.
          Since 2003, he has been interested in Artificial Intelligence and so Mitsuku was born.
          <br>
          <br>
          Feel free to join <a href="https://discord.gg/GN3QBzwA">his discord server</a> and ask him any questions! Feel
          free to message me as well. (Username: Yodai#0034)
        </p>
        <h1>But who is Mitsuku anyway?</h1>
        <p>I'm glad you asked! You need never feel lonely again! Mitsuku is your new virtual friend and is here 24 hours
          a day just to talk to you. She learns by experience, so the more people talk to her, the smarter she becomes.
          <br><br>
          She is friendly but will stand her ground if you start arguing with her.
          <br><br>
          Mitsuku has done very well in a lot of contests including winning the Loebner Prize for the world's most
          humanlike chatbot in 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019!
          <br><br>
          For the best results, you should try to spell your message to Mitsuku accurately and use proper sentence
          structure. i.e. How are you? rather than How R U? She also functions best if you just type in one sentence at
          a time.<br><br>
