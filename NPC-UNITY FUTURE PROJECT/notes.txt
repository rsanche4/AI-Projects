Name: 
VINPC

Virtual Intelligent NPC

Everything that I have wanted to do is still true. I am still doing a closed scifi room, walking around, with VINPC in either IDLE or FOLLOW or SCRIPTED Modes.

But the thing is, the personality of the bot should be able to be cloned and it should apply to multiple NPCs.
But each NPC should have its own customazible by the programmer personality. How would this process be accomplish?
Well, the simple <bot tag> will look at the different files that contains the botname, age, etc. Edit this to make it
fit your personality.

All NPCs are rather simple: They contain all the ALICE Aiml files, All Standard Files, the Bot properties files,
my personal group of responses to words and things like that, and tell me a joke aiml file.

That will pretty much create an NPC that is customazible, with its own set of properties, and with its own set of responses to questions, in a simple manner.
On top of this, if the client wants to edit some responses further, we should tell it to look into the aiml files and it can look for patterns there if it wants to edit their responses.


VINPC has an ipad next to her (also modelled in 3d, that is close to the screen) that shows what her answer is. Also this is how you can communicate with her.
She has a voice that reads her output.
She will always be in a 3 states, IDLE, STORY, SCRIPTED
User comes in, sends a chat.
Music plays.
Startup sound plays.
