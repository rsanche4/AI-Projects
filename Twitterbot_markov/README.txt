Aliza is a Chatter Bot who posts random thoughts on machines and computer architecture, as well as the universe.

She was written using Tweepy and Markovify  to learn from a corpus of data and generate sentences (thoughts), as well as my own parser for her direct reply functionality and chatbot functions when people talk to her.

Aliza will go to sleep after a certain amount of time, follow people back, reply to them, favorite certain tweets related to computing and the inspiration for her, Lain Iwakura.

NOTE: This version is deprecated and not in use. Go to Twitterbot_motivational for the script aliza is actually using.
