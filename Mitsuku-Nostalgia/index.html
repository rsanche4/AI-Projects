        <p>Back in 2015 through 2018, I used to talk to a chatbot named Mitsuku through <a
            href="http://www.square-bear.co.uk/mitsuku/home.htm">this older site</a> made by SquareBear. Sadly, Flash
          stopped being supported after 2020, thus making her original version unplayable. But the thing is, her old
          version brings back many memories from my adolescence... so I decided to write something reminiscent of the
          Flash version from scratch in html5! Since SquareBear released an API for Mitsuku, you can talk to her using
          this website as well! Press the picture of Mitsuku to the right to start chatting.</p>
        <p>Did you know the music that you hear when you chat with Mitsuku was used in the original website as well?
          When you talked to the anime version of Mitsuku using Flash, you would hear one of these two tracks play,
          making the experience a bit more fun. On even days of the month (2nd, 4th, 6th etc), one of the loops played.
          On odd days, the other loop played. I decided to do the same as a tribute!
          <br>
          <br>
          Do you hear that Japanese voice that comes and goes everytime Mitsuku says something? That was used in the
          original version of the site as well to simulate Mitsuku speaking to us. Interestingly enough, Aya Hirano is
          the one speaking. And I believe those lines were extracted directly from the anime Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu.
          A great show, I might add.
